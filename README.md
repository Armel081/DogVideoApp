# About
A little mock-up site i created mirroring the site CatVideoApp from FreeCodeCamp's beta Responsive Web Design curriculum for my own practicing purposes. All rights reserved to their respective owners.

### INSTRUCTIONS

Download as zip and open the file "DogVideoApp.html" to get started on the main page. Also, don't touch anything else from the folder, as that may cause some elements on the page to break or not load correctly
