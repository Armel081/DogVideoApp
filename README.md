# DogVideoApp

## About
A little mock-up site i created mirroring the CatPhotoApp site from [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) beta Responsive Web Design curriculum, which i made for my own practicing purposes. All rights reserved to their respective owners.

### INSTRUCTIONS

[**Click here**](https://armel081.github.io/DogVideoApp)</ins> if you want to view the site online through Github Pages, or if you prefer to download a local copy, go to to the <ins>[**Releases**](https://github.com/Armel081/DogVideoApp/releases)</ins> page, download the latest version of the ``` DogVideoApp-release.zip``` file, extract the ```DogVideoApp-release``` folder, then click on ```index.html``` to get started on the main page. Also, don't touch anything else from the folder, as that may cause elements on the page to break and/or not load correctly.

I am simply a user of their platform, and this site was created for my own practicing purposes.
