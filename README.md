# DogVideoApp

## About
A little mock-up site i created mirroring the CatPhotoApp site from [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org) beta Responsive Web Design curriculum, which i made for my own practicing purposes. All rights reserved to their respective owners.

### INSTRUCTIONS

Click on "**Code**" at the top, download as ZIP, extract the files to a new folder, and open the file ```DogVideoApp.html``` to get started on the main page. Also, don't touch anything else from the folder, as that may cause elements on the page to break and/or not load correctly.

#### Attributions
