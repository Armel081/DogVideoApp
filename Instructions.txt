Hello there! In case you haven't already, extract the folder "DogVideoApp-release" to somewhere on your computer, 
then open up "Sites" and double click on the file "DogVideoApp.html" to go onto the website. Also, don't touch anything else from the folder, 
as that might break some stuff on the website. Other than that, have fun!
